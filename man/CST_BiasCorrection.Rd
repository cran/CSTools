\usage{
CST_BiasCorrection(
  exp,
  obs,
  exp_cor = NULL,
  na.rm = FALSE,
  memb_dim = "member",
  sdate_dim = "sdate",
  ncores = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{exp}{An object of class \code{s2dv_cube} as returned by \code{CST_Load} 
function, containing the seasonal forecast experiment data in the element 
named \code{$data}}

\item{obs}{An object of class \code{s2dv_cube} as returned by \code{CST_Load} 
function, containing the observed data in the element named \code{$data}.}

\item{exp_cor}{An object of class \code{s2dv_cube} as returned by 
\code{CST_Load} function, containing the seasonl forecast experiment to be 
corrected. If it is NULL, the 'exp' forecast will be corrected.}

\item{na.rm}{A logical value indicating whether missing values should be 
stripped before the computation proceeds, by default it is set to FALSE.}

\item{memb_dim}{A character string indicating the name of the member 
dimension. By default, it is set to 'member'.}

\item{sdate_dim}{A character string indicating the name of the start date 
dimension. By default, it is set to 'sdate'.}

\item{ncores}{An integer that indicates the number of cores for parallel 
computations using multiApply function. The default value is NULL.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{s2dv_cube} containing the bias corrected 
forecasts with the same dimensions of the experimental data.
}
\description{
This function applies the simple bias adjustment technique 
described in Torralba et al. (2017). The adjusted forecasts have an equivalent 
standard deviation and mean to that of the reference dataset.
