\title{CSTools Data Retreival Function}
\usage{
CST_Load(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Parameters that are automatically forwarded to the `s2dverification::Load` function. See details in `?s2dverification::Load`.}
}
\value{
A list with one or two S3 objects, named 'exp' and 'obs', of the class 's2dv_cube', containing experimental and date-corresponding observational data, respectively. These 's2dv_cube's can be ingested by other functions in CSTools. If the parameter `exp` in the call to `CST_Load` is set to `NULL`, then only the 'obs' component is returned, and viceversa.
}
\description{
This function aggregates, subsets and retrieves sub-seasonal, seasonal, decadal or climate projection data from NetCDF files in a local file system or on remote OPeNDAP servers, and arranges it for easy application of the CSTools functions.
}
\details{
It receives any number of parameters (`...`) that are automatically forwarded to the `s2dverification::Load` function. See details in `?s2dverification::Load`.

It is recommended to use this function in combination with the `zeallot::"%<-%"` operator, to directly assing the two returned 's2dv_cube's to two separate variables, which can then be sent independently to other functions in CSTools as needed. E.g.: `c(exp, obs) <- CST_Load(...)`.
