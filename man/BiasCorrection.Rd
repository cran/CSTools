\usage{
BiasCorrection(
  exp,
  obs,
  exp_cor = NULL,
  na.rm = FALSE,
  memb_dim = "member",
  sdate_dim = "sdate",
  ncores = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{exp}{A multidimensional array with named dimensions containing the 
seasonal forecast experiment data with at least 'member' and 'sdate' 
dimensions.}

\item{obs}{A multidimensional array with named dimensions containing the 
observed data with at least 'sdate' dimension.}

\item{exp_cor}{A multidimensional array with named dimensions containing the 
seasonl forecast experiment to be corrected. If it is NULL, the 'exp' 
forecast will be corrected.}

\item{na.rm}{A logical value indicating whether missing values should be 
stripped before the computation proceeds, by default it is set to FALSE.}

\item{memb_dim}{A character string indicating the name of the member 
dimension. By default, it is set to 'member'.}

\item{sdate_dim}{A character string indicating the name of the start date 
dimension. By default, it is set to 'sdate'.}

\item{ncores}{An integer that indicates the number of cores for parallel 
computations using multiApply function. The default value is NULL.}
}
\value{
An array containing the bias corrected forecasts with the same 
dimensions of the experimental data.
}
\description{
This function applies the simple bias adjustment technique 
described in Torralba et al. (2017). The adjusted forecasts have an equivalent 
standard deviation and mean to that of the reference dataset.
