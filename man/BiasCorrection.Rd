\title{Bias Correction based on the mean and standard deviation adjustment}
\usage{
BiasCorrection(exp, obs, exp_cor = NULL, na.rm = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{exp}{a multidimensional array with named dimensions containing the seasonal forecast experiment data with at least 'member' and 'sdate' dimensions.}

\item{obs}{a multidimensional array with named dimensions containing the observed data with at least 'sdate' dimension.}

\item{exp_cor}{a multidimensional array with named dimensions containing the seasonl forecast experiment to be corrected. If it is NULL, the 'exp' forecast will be corrected.}

\item{na.rm}{a logical value indicating whether missing values should be stripped before the computation proceeds, by default it is set to FALSE.}
}
\value{
an object of class \code{s2dv_cube} containing the bias corrected forecasts in the element called \code{$data} with the same dimensions of the experimental data.
}
\description{
This function applies the simple bias adjustment technique described in Torralba et al. (2017). The adjusted forecasts have an equivalent standard deviation and mean to that of the reference dataset.

# Example
# Creation of sample s2dverification objects. These are not complete
# s2dverification objects though. The Load function returns complete objects.
