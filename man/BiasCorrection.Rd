\usage{
BiasCorrection(
  exp,
  obs,
  exp_cor = NULL,
  na.rm = FALSE,
  memb_dim = "member",
  sdate_dim = "sdate",
  dat_dim = NULL,
  ncores = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{exp}{A multidimensional array with named dimensions containing the 
seasonal forecast experiment data with at least time and member dimensions.}

\item{obs}{A multidimensional array with named dimensions containing the 
observed data with at least time dimension.}

\item{exp_cor}{A multidimensional array with named dimensions containing the 
seasonal forecast experiment to be corrected with at least time and member 
dimension. If it is NULL, the 'exp' forecast will be corrected. If there is 
only one corrected dataset, it should not have dataset dimension. If there 
is a corresponding corrected dataset for each 'exp' forecast, the dataset 
dimension must have the same length as in 'exp'. The default value is NULL.}

\item{na.rm}{A logical value indicating whether missing values should be 
stripped before the computation proceeds, by default it is set to FALSE.}

\item{memb_dim}{A character string indicating the name of the member 
dimension. By default, it is set to 'member'.}

\item{sdate_dim}{A character string indicating the name of the start date 
dimension. By default, it is set to 'sdate'.}

\item{dat_dim}{A character string indicating the name of dataset dimension. 
The length of this dimension can be different between 'exp' and 'obs'. 
The default value is NULL.}

\item{ncores}{An integer that indicates the number of cores for parallel 
computations using multiApply function. The default value is NULL.}
}
\value{
An array containing the bias corrected forecasts with the dimensions 
nexp, nobs and same dimensions as in the 'exp' object. nexp is the number of 
experiment (i.e., 'dat_dim' in exp), and nobs is the number of observation 
(i.e., 'dat_dim' in obs). If dat_dim is NULL, nexp and nobs are omitted. If 
'exp_cor' is provided the returned array will be with the same dimensions as 
'exp_cor'.
}
\description{
This function applies the simple bias adjustment technique 
described in Torralba et al. (2017). The adjusted forecasts have an equivalent 
standard deviation and mean to that of the reference dataset.
