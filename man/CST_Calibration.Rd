\title{Forecast Calibration based on the ensemble inflation}
\usage{
CST_Calibration(exp, obs)
}
\arguments{
\item{exp}{an object of class \code{s2dv_cube} as returned by \code{CST_Load} function, containing the seasonal forecast experiment data in the element named \code{$data}.}

\item{obs}{an object of class \code{s2dv_cube} as returned by \code{CST_Load} function, containing the observed data in the element named \code{$data}.}
}
\value{
an object of class \code{s2dv_cube} containing the calibrated forecasts in the element \code{$data} with the same dimensions of the experimental data.
}
\description{
This function applies a variance inflation technique described in Doblas-Reyes et al. (2005) in leave-one-out cross-validation. This bias adjustment method produces calibrated forecasts with equivalent mean and variance to that of the reference dataset, but at the same time preserve reliability.
