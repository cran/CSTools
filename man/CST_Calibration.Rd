\usage{
CST_Calibration(
  exp,
  obs,
  cal.method = "mse_min",
  eval.method = "leave-one-out",
  multi.model = FALSE,
  na.fill = TRUE,
  ncores = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{exp}{an object of class \code{s2dv_cube} as returned by \code{CST_Load} function, containing the seasonal forecast experiment data in the element named \code{$data}.}

\item{obs}{an object of class \code{s2dv_cube} as returned by \code{CST_Load} function, containing the observed data in the element named \code{$data}.}

\item{cal.method}{is the calibration method used, can be either \code{bias}, \code{evmos}, \code{mse_min} or \code{crps_min}. Default value is \code{mse_min}.}

\item{eval.method}{is the sampling method used, can be either \code{in-sample} or \code{leave-one-out}. Default value is the \code{leave-one-out} cross validation.}

\item{multi.model}{is a boolean that is used only for the \code{mse_min} method. If multi-model ensembles or ensembles of different sizes are used, it must be set to \code{TRUE}. By default it is \code{FALSE}. Differences between the two approaches are generally small but may become large when using small ensemble sizes. Using multi.model when the calibration method is \code{bias}, \code{evmos} or \code{crps_min} will not affect the result.}

\item{na.fill}{is a boolean that indicates what happens in case calibration is not possible or will yield unreliable results. This happens when three or less forecasts-observation pairs are available to perform the training phase of the calibration. By default \code{na.fill} is set to true such that NA values will be returned. If \code{na.fill} is set to false, the uncorrected data will be returned.}

\item{ncores}{is an integer that indicates the number of cores for parallel computations using multiApply function. The default value is one.}
}
\value{
an object of class \code{s2dv_cube} containing the calibrated forecasts in the element \code{$data} with the same dimensions as the one in the exp object.
}
\description{
Equivalent to function \code{Calibration} but for objects of class \code{s2dv_cube}.
