\usage{
CST_Calibration(exp, obs, cal.method = "mse_min",
  eval.method = "leave-one-out", multi.model = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{exp}{an object of class \code{s2dv_cube} as returned by \code{CST_Load} function, containing the seasonal forecast experiment data in the element named \code{$data}.}

\item{obs}{an object of class \code{s2dv_cube} as returned by \code{CST_Load} function, containing the observed data in the element named \code{$data}.}

\item{cal.method}{is the calibration method used, can be either \code{bias}, \code{evmos}, \code{mse_min} or \code{crps_min}. Default value is \code{mse_min}.}

\item{eval.method}{is the sampling method used, can be either \code{in-sample} or \code{leave-one-out}. Default value is the \code{leave-one-out} cross validation.}

\item{multi.model}{is a boolean that is used only for the \code{mse_min} method. If multi-model ensembles or ensembles of different sizes are used, it must be set to \code{TRUE}. By default it is \code{FALSE}. Differences between the two approaches are generally small but may become large when using small ensemble sizes. Using multi.model when the calibration method is \code{bias}, \code{evmos} or \code{crps_min} will not affect the result.}
}
\value{
an object of class \code{s2dv_cube} containing the calibrated forecasts in the element \code{$data} with the same dimensions of the experimental data.
}
\description{
Four types of member-by-member bias correction can be performed. The \code{bias} method corrects the bias only, the \code{evmos} method applies a variance inflation technique to ensure the correction of the bias and the correspondence of variance between forecast and observation (Van Schaeybroeck and Vannitsem, 2011). The ensemble calibration methods \code{"mse_min"} and \code{"crps_min"} correct the bias, the overall forecast variance and the ensemble spread as described in Doblas-Reyes et al. (2005) and Van Schaeybroeck and Vannitsem (2015), respectively. While the \code{"mse_min"} method minimizes a constrained mean-squared error using three parameters, the \code{"crps_min"} method features four parameters and minimizes the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS).

Both in-sample or our out-of-sample (leave-one-out cross validation) calibration are possible.
